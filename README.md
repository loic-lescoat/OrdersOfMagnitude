# Orders Of Magnitude


This Android app helps put into perspective how certain actions are many times worse for the environment than others, by offering a visual comparison of how much carbon dioxide different actions give off. See it in action [here](https://youtu.be/B9fIDOSmFIA).

This app uses custom Views to make the colored discs visible on the interface, and uses animations to smoothely change the content onscreen.
